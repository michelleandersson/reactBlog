        <p>Well, how'd you become king, then? Oh, ow! Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! We want a 
            shrubbery!! We found them. Who's that then?
        </p>
        <p>Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! The nose? We want a shrubbery!! Well, I got better.
        </p>
        <p>The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, 
            sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English 
            K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!
        </p>
        <p>Bring her forward! Shut up! Will you shut up?! Look, my liege! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one.
        </p>
        <p>You don't vote for kings. Burn her anyway! Now, look here, my good man. Burn her! Where'd you get the coconuts? 
            I'm not a witch.
        </p>
